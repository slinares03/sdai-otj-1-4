        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their love for software into a culinary adventure. 
            After years of coding by day and cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions and create something extraordinary.
